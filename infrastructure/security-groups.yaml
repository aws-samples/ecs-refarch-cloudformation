  This template contains the security groups required by our entire stack.
  We create them in a seperate nested template, so they can be referenced
  by all of the other nested templates.

  EnvironmentName:
    Description: An environment name that will be prefixed to resource names
    Type: String

  VPC:
    Type: AWS::EC2::VPC::Id
    Description: Choose which VPC the security groups should be deployed to

Resources:
  # This security group defines who/where is allowed to access the ECS hosts directly.
  # By default we're just allowing access from the load balancer.  If you want to SSH
  # into the hosts, or expose non-load balanced services you can open their ports here.
